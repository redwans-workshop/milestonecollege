Welcome to Milestone College. We, being backed up by a number of specialist teaching staff and excellent facilities and resources, offer a wide range of courses in the college. Ours is a non-profitable organization established by the MNRS TRUST. Now, it is run by a Board of Governors approved by the Board of Intermediate & Secondary Education, Dhaka under the Ministry of Education, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The institution, growing from a Kindergarten to a Junior School and then to a Secondary School, has now emerged as a leading College of Bangladesh. Since inception, the institute has been enjoying a proud record of academic excellence and innovations. Over the years, it has generated a significant number of employments of qualified academicians, administrators and a set of dynamic staff.<br /><br />

50% of our students come to this college following personal recommendations from the previous students or their parents. The management firmly believes that its prime perspective is to help the students in achieving sound potentialities and create a perfect environment for fruitful and prospective studies.<br /><br />

It has already earned a good reputation for its sole professional, affectionately caring and supportive environment. We take personal care of each and every student and remain ever vigilant to his/her development in every field of learning (Moral teaching, discipline, physical development, psychological & emotional cognisance, academic performance etc). At every step of learning we provide them with the necessary guidance, advice and extra help as and when needed. We have students from different backgrounds, castes and creeds from all over Bangladesh (1500 students residing in the hostel). We have 05 (five) campuses at Uttara Model Town, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh. Each campus is independently equipped with all modern amenities & facilities. In our English Medium section, we follow the national curriculum (S.S.C & H.S.C syllabus) in English version. This has aroused a great interest amongst the guardians. This section is headed by a Colonel (retd.) of Bangladesh Army.<br /><br />

We have Modern Laboratories and facilities for curricular and co-curricular activities. Stage events such as Debate, Extempore Speech, Recitation, Seminar, General Knowledge & Wall Magazine Competition, etc. It takes place every week in our own Auditorium. We publish our College Magazine every year showing all-the-year-round activities and students' literary and cultural contributions. We also organize seminars, symposiums and work-shops on regular basis to facilitate interactive teaching environment.<br /><br />

Our academic achievement is excellent. In 2008, the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka under the Ministry of Education has adjudged our college as one of the best educational Institutes under Dhaka Board.<br /><br />

In the current session Ms Renee Robinson, one of the senior teachers of Cambridge, UK constantly worked for long with our teachers & students. She also conducted a month-long training course on English Language, Teaching Methods and Child Development. As a follow up of the programme we have arranged the visit of Ms Jane Hunt, another Senior British Teacher for a period of three months for the same purpose.<br /><br />

We believe that teaching is a continous process and we emphasize on its smooth and everlasting perfection.<br /><br />

Thanking you.<br /><br /><br />
