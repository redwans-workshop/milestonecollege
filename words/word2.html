Welcome to Milestone College online deliberations !<br>

As an ardent believer in the maxim “Education is the backbone of a nation”, we have been striving hard to contribute a bit to the act of building a strong nation in the future. Since its inception in 2002, Milestone College has been investing all its efforts to impart quality education giving equal importance to co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. Our institution, within a very short time, was performing better than many of the top ranking institutions in public exams and in various national / district level and inter-school competitions. Milestone College has been successful in establishing its position among the leading Schools of the country by dint of the praiseworthy performances of its students in the public exams at Secondary and Higher Secondary levels.<br>

Our teams of diligent faculty members working at the frontline has always been Milestone College’s most valuable asset. Their direct supervision and hard work round the clock help our students to perform consistently well in the Public Exams. For example in the SSC Exam 2020, 1381 students appeared and 946 got GPA 5.00 and 100% of them have passed out. Channel-i, a leading TV Channel in Bangladesh enumerates Milestone College the best Educational Institution in Dhaka Mohanogori on the basis of its 100% turn out in the SSC 2020. In the JSC 2019 Exam where 60 (sixty) scholarships were awarded in total (Cantonment Thana) in the talent pool & general quota, Milestone College students successfully achieved 59 (fifty-nine).<br>

We maintain separate campus for our girls where the Vice Principals/ In-charges, Directors, Coordinators, Form Masters are all females. We strive for gender equality among our students and staff and currently our female-male ratio among the students and the staff is 2:3 which we aspire to increase to 1:1 in the immediate future. On a different note, our English and Bangla version students attend classes in separate buildings and have separate administrative and academic support systems.<br>

At Milestone College, we truly believe that in order to achieve personal and professional proficiencies, a student needs to be strong both in academic and extra-curricular activities. Our achievements in Sports & Cultural Activities at national & international levels bear testimony to our efforts and belief.<br>

<b>The following is a titbit list of some of our achievements in the recent times:</b><br>

<b>*In the National Education Week-2019,</b> Milestone School & College was attributed the best Educational Institution (Secondary), the best Principal (Higher Secondary) & 02 (two) of our students the best students (both Secondary & Higher Secondary) at Thana Level (Mohanogori).<br>

<b>*Anti-Corruption Debate Competition:</b> In The National Anti-Corruption Debate Competition held in March 2020. Milestone College came out Champion in 04 (four) Thanas in Uttara.<br>

<b>*In the Competition of Rendering the National Anthem</b> Correctly held in 2019 the Junior Group from Milestone College stood 1st at Thana Level & 2nd at District level.<br>

<b>*In the 49th Sports Competition (2019-20)</b> arranged by the National School Madrasha & Technical Education Institutes other than achieving individual medals out of the 10 (ten) Group Events Milestone College came out Champion in 09 (nine).<br>

*Our BNCC Cadet <b>Sayan Azad</b> took part in the Desert Safari Camping held at Rajsthan in India in 2019 & our BNCC Cadet <b>Mehnaz Habib Rangdhanu</b> took part in the Republic Day March Past of India in 2020 as a State Guest.<br>

<b>*In the Chinese Bridge Competition-2012,</b> our student <b>Shaer Sabab Uthsa</b> stood 1st among the foreign linguals.<br>

A team of 15 (fifteen) students of classes IX-XII of Milestone College participated in a conference of the Dhaka University National Model United Nations (DUNMUN) held for three days from 12 to 14 October 2019 at Nawab Ali Chowdhury Senate Bhaban, two of them namely Md. Zihan Hasan (Passed SSC 2020) & Ishmam Alvee (the then XI-SC-C Boys, EV-9569) were awarded <b>Certificate for “Special Mention”</b> & <b>Certificate for “Honorable Mention”</b> respectively.<br>

Bangladesh Taekwondo Federation arranged a Korean Martial Art “Taekwondo” Training Course specially designated for the girls under the supervision of a team of experts from South Korea.<br>

We have our own permanent campus in the heart of the Uttara Model Town (3rd Phase) just beside the ongoing Metro Rail Terminal, Uttara, minutes’ away from the Rupayan City, Fantasy Island, BRTA Office and Fire Brigade Station with all sorts of outdoor and indoor facilities for our students including gymnasium, field, basketball court, volleyball court etc.  It stands at a close proximity to cities like Savar, Ashulia, Mirpur, Mohakhali, Gulshan, Dakkhinkhan, Uttarkhan, Pubail and Gazipur and has an easy access to public transports. With the opening of the Metro Rail transport link, our students will be able to reach our campus from the areas like Motijheel etc. in a matter of some minutes. We also provide our students ample facilities with separate academic and hostel buildings for the girls and the boys.<br>

We take the safety matter of our students and staff very seriously. Our team of security guards led by a retired Defense personnel is constantly at watch to ensure the safety and security of our students and staff members. They also take special measures to prevent illegal and health vitiating activities within our premises. <br> 

Educationists believe that psychological as well as physical fitness of students is a pre-requisite to better learning. We have physical trainers, a full-time physician and a system of continuous motivation and counselling is our everyday business. One experienced psychiatrist keeps constant vigilance over those and guides them how to be away from any kind of juvenile delinquencies. We have a high standard of motivation module to handle every problem – academic and / or administrative – instantly and effectively. It’s again a pleasure on my part to inform you that we have two enriched libraries continuously being developed with valuable and essential books and periodicals.<br>

And for all these, there are about 350 (three hundred and fifty) teachers working in this section alone. In total we have over 10,000 (ten thousand) students & 612 (six hundred & twelve) teachers including 06 (six) retired defence officers, 05 (five) retired Professors from Cadet Colleges, 02 (two) retired Principals from Cadet Colleges; 02 (two) retired Principals from Govt. Colleges; 09 (nine) Associate Professors, 89 (eighty-nine) Assistant Professors and the rest Lecturers working in this college.<br>

To conclude I, on behalf of Milestone College administration, affirmly assure you a bright & glorious prospect of your beloved wards at Milestone College.<br><br>
