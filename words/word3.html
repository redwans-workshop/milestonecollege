I welcome you all to Milestone College and express my heartfelt thanks for visiting us online.<br>

We consider every child as unique and so we maintain inclusive learning-teaching environment at every step in our great set-up. It is a fact now that our results are getting better in the public examinations every time. It has been made possible through our extensive and effective care stretched out to every individual student.<br>

Our students conglomerate here from multifarious backgrounds; various strata of the society. They enter the threshold of our strong and fortified home of learning with a view to getting better facilities. And it is something we value highly that most of the students get higher GPA in HSC Exam than that of SSC Exam.<br>

<b>Our School Section is an integral part of greater Milestone Family. Results of the school section in Public exams are given below: </b><br>

<b>Primary Extermination Certificate (PEC) Examination-2019:</b> 1181 students appeared (Both English & Bangla Mediums); all passed. Pass percentage was 100%; 1138 students got GPA 5.00. Obtained 34 Talent Pool & 05 General Scholarships from own Thana. Our Position was 3rd in the year 2013 & 2014 and 4th in the country in the year 2011 & 2012 (in order of merit).<br>

<b>Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination-2019:</b> 1071 students appeared (Both English & Bangla Mediums); all passed. Pass percentage was 100%; 576 students got GPA 5.00. Obtained 20 Talent Pool out of 20 & 39 General Scholarships out of 40 from own Thana.<br>

In 2013, 958 students appeared (Both English & Bangla Mediums); all passed. Pass percentage was 100%; 868 students got GPA 5.00 & secured 4th Position in Dhaka Board.<br>

We put our students into unequivocal discipline, rear them up with their shoulders erect, guide them to the emerald path of success and when they come out with their heads up at the end of their academic session, they certainly attain better GPA compared to the previous ones. Regular Class Tests, Weekly Tests and Monthly Tests help students become aware all the more of their existing status for the preparation of their studies further. We keep close contact with guardians and brief them about their wards’ academic state of affairs. A coordinated effort on the part of the guardians, College administration, teachers and students has thus made our dream, intention and efforts a success. Quite naturally we also pay equal stress on the moral and spiritual development of our students. Arrangement of Orientation Course for the newly recruited teachers as well as periodic training for the teachers and regular co-curricular & extra-curricular activities for the students are our coherent features.<br>

It may be a repetition to many that we have developed a system of bringing out the potentials of a student through the process of MTs (Monthly Tests), FTs (Fortnightly Tests), STs (Surprise Tests) and Term End Exams along with arrangements of Detention Classes for weak students categorising them on academic and/or discipline grounds. The mechanism of co-ordination amongst guardians, Form Masters, Students, Teachers and Administration is a trademark for this institution that ultimately leaves no student unattended.<br>

Digitization which we have ensured as an inevitable part of our class-room teaching and all other academic activities has assuredly raised us to the global stature. Now you can get us at www.milestonecollege.edu.bd and www.milestonecollege.com with updated information regarding admission, current results, payment procedures and all necessary information making everybody’s access to Milestone College quite easy.<br>

We pledge to persist in carrying with the best of our efforts in the days to come.<br><br>
